   1. App name: Billboard To Spotify
   2. App description: (it's up to you)

## Usage

Instalation

```cmd
# Clone the repo on your current cwd
git clone git@github.com:hiahir357/billboard-to-spotify

# Go to the repo folder
cd billboard-to-spotify

# Install the requirements
# Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Linux
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Creating a playlist

```cmd
$ python main.py
Which year do you want to travel to? Type de date in this format YYYY-MM-DD -> 2002-08-12
```

The first time you run it, it'll open a window for authorizing your Spotify account to use the app. In that case, you have to agree and wait for a redirection. Copy the whole url from it and paste it in the console. It should be displaying something like this:

`$ Enter the URL you were redirected to: <paste the url here>`

## That's all

I hope you enjoy it ðŸ˜Š
